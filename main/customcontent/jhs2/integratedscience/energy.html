			<h1>How Electricity Is Made</h1>
			<p>
				Have you ever wondered where electricity comes from? You might be surprised to learn that it comes from magnets!
			</p>
			<p>
				In the early 1800s, <a href="http://www.alliantenergykids.com/EnergyBasics/EnergyInventors/index.htm">Michael Faraday</a> discovered "electromagnetic
				induction", which is the scientific way of saying that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, the wire would become electrified.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1882, <a href="http://www.alliantenergykids.com/EnergyBasics/EnergyInventors/index.htm">Thomas Edison</a> opened the first full-scale power plant in New
				York City. Edison's electric generator was a bigger version of Faraday's basic experiment; a big magnet rotates around a wire to produce an electric
				current.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today's power plants are bigger and controlled by computers, but the basic process is still the same as it was nearly 120 years ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Electricity generation</strong>
			is the process of generating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a> from other sources of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a>.. The other processes, electricity<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a>,    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution" title="Electric power distribution">distribution</a>, and electrical power storage and
				recovery using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage</a> methods
				are normally carried out by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_industry" title="Electric power industry">electric power industry</a>.
			Electricity is most often generated at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power station</a> by electromechanical<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">generators</a>, primarily driven by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_engine" title="Heat engine">heat engines</a> fueled by chemical<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> or<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> but also by other means such as the    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of flowing water and wind.

			<p>
				<h2>Ways of generating electricity</h2>
			</p>
			<h3>
				Static electricity
			</h3>
			<p>
				Static electricity often happens when you rub things together. If you rub a balloon against your jumper 20 or 30 times, you'll find the balloon sticks to
			you. This happens because rubbing the balloon gives it an electric charge (a small amount of electricity). The charge makes it stick to your jumper like a    <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/magnetism.html">magnet</a>, because your jumper gains an opposite electric charge. So your jumper and the balloon
				attract one another like the opposite ends of two magnets.

			</p>
			<p>
				Have you ever walked across a <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/nylon.html">nylon</a> rug or carpet and felt a slight tingling sensation? Then
				touched something metal, like a door knob or a faucet (tap), and felt a sharp pain in your hand? That is an example of an electric shock. When you walk
				across the rug, your feet are rubbing against it. Your body gradually builds up an electric charge, which is the tingling you can sense. When you touch
				metal, the charge runs instantly to Earth—and that's the shock you feel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lightning is also caused by static electricity. As rain clouds move through the sky, they rub against the air around them. This makes them build up a huge
				electric charge. Eventually, when the charge is big enough, it leaps to Earth as a bolt of lightning. You can often feel the tingling in the air when a
			storm is brewing nearby. This is the electricity in the air around you. Read more about this in our article on    <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/capacitors.html">capacitors</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Hydro Power</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				"Hydro" means "water" in Greek - so "hydro power" is made from water.
			</p>
			<p>
				It might sound odd that we can use water to make electricity because they're a dangerous combination, right? Actually, the water never comes in contact
				with the electricity. The water flowing down a river is used to spin the turbines inside the generator.

				<h3>Wind Energy and Wind Power</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				Wind is a form of <strong>solar energy</strong>. Winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's
				surface, and rotation of the earth. Wind flow patterns are modified by the earth's terrain, bodies of water, and vegetative cover. This wind flow, or
				motion energy, when "harvested" by modern <strong>wind turbines</strong>, can be used to generate <strong>electricity</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>How Wind Power Is Generated</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
			The terms "<strong>wind energy</strong>" or "<strong>wind power</strong>" describe the process by which the wind is used to generate    <strong>mechanical power or electricity</strong>. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be
				used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water) or a generator can convert this mechanical power into electricity to power homes,
				businesses, schools, and the like.

													We can use solar power in two different ways: as a heat source, and as an energy source. People have used the sun as a
													heat source for thousands of years. Families in ancient Greece built their homes to get the most sunlight during the

				In the 1830s, the British astronomer John Herschel used a solar collector box to cook food during an expedition to Africa. Now, people are trying to use
				the sun's energy for lots of things. Electric utilities are trying photovoltaics, a process by which solar energy is converted directly to electricity.
				Electricity can be produced directly from solar energy using photovoltaic devices or indirectly from steam generators using solar thermal collectors to
				heat a working fluid.

									What is the difference between "solar energy" and "photovoltaic?
									<br/>
									<br/>
									Photovoltaic is one form of solar energy. The term solar energy can refer to something as simple the energy gathered in your parked,
									sealed car (your solar collector) and converted into heat. Solar energy is often used to heat houses directly through passive means
									(sun enters window, room warms). Solar energy is also often used to heat water (a solar collector is mounted in direct sunlight, which
									warms a heat transfer fluid, which in turn heats the water in your hot water tank).
									<br/>
									Photovoltaic refers specifically to the practice of converting the sun's energy directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
									Photovoltaic cells are often referred to as PV cells or solar cells.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td colspan="2">
								<p>
									Photovoltaic energy is the conversion of sunlight into electricity through a photovoltaic (PVs) cell, commonly called a solar cell. A
									photovoltaic cell is a non-mechanical device usually made from silicon alloys.
									<br/>
									Sunlight is composed of photons, or particles of solar energy. These photons contain various amounts of energy corresponding to the
									different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. When photons strike a photovoltaic cell, they may be reflected, pass right through, or be
									absorbed. Only the absorbed photons provide energy to generate electricity. When enough sunlight (energy) is absorbed by the material
									(a semiconductor), electrons are dislodged from the material's atoms. Special treatment of the material surface during manufacturing
									makes the front surface of the cell more receptive to free electrons, so the electrons naturally migrate to the surface.

				</a>
				that store chemical energy for later conversion to electrical energy. Batteries are used in many day-to-day devices such as cellular phones, laptop
				computers, clocks, and cars. Batteries are composed of at least one electrochemical cell which is used for the storage and generation of electricity.
				Though a variety of electrochemical cells exist, batteries generally consist of at least one
				<a href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Analytical_Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Voltaic_Cells" title="Analytical Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Voltaic Cells">
					voltaic cell
				</a>
				. Voltaic cells are also sometimes referred to as galvanic cells. Chemical reactions and the generation of electrical energy is spontaneous within a
				voltaic cell, as opposed to the reactions

			</p>
			<p>
				It was while conducting experiments on electricity in 1749 that Benjamin Franklin first coined the term "battery" to describe linked capacitors. However
				his battery was not the first battery, just the first ever referred to as such. Rather it is believed that the Baghdad Batteries, discovered in 1936 and
				over 2,000 years old, were some of the first ever batteries, though their exact purpose is still debated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luigi Galvani (for whom the galvanic cell is named) first described "animal electricity" in 1780 when he created an electrical current through a frog.
				Though he was not aware of it at the time, this was a form of a battery. His contemporary Alessandro Volta (for whom the voltaic cell and voltaic pile are
				named) was convinced that the "animal electricity" was not coming from the frog, but something else entirely. In 1800, his produced the first real battery:
				the voltaic pile
			</p>
			<h3>

			<h3>
				Voltaic Cells
			</h3>
			<p>
				Voltaic cells are composed of two half-cell reactions (
				<a
					href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Analytical_Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Redox_Chemistry/Oxidation-Reduction_Reactions"
					title="Analytical Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Redox Chemistry/Oxidation-Reduction Reactions"
				>
					oxidation-reduction
				</a>
				) linked together via a semi permeable membrane (generally a salt bath) and a wire (Figure 1). Each side of the cell contains a metal that acts as an
				<a
					href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Analytical_Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Electrodes/Standard_Hydrogen_Electrode"
					title="Analytical Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Electrodes/Standard Hydrogen Electrode"
				>
					electrode
				</a>
				. One of the electrodes is termed the cathode, and the other is termed the anode. The side of the cell containing the cathode is reduced, meaning it gains
				electrons and acts as the oxidizing agent for the anode. The side of the cell containing the anode is where oxidation occurs, meaning it loses electrons
				and acts as the reducing agent for the cathode. The two electrodes are each submerged in an

					title="Physical Chemistry/Physical Properties of Matter/Solutions/Electrolyte Solutions"
				>
					electrolyte
				</a>
				, a compound that consists of ions. This electrolyte acts as a concentration gradient for both sides of the half reaction, facilitating the process of the
				electron transfer through the wire. This movement of electrons is what produces energy and is used to power the battery.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cell is separated into two compartments because the chemical reaction is spontaneous. If the reaction was to occur without this separation, energy in
				the form of heat would be released and the battery would not be effective.

			<h4>
				Primary Batteries
			</h4>
			<p>
				Primary batteries are non-rechargeable and disposable. The electrochemical reactions in these batteries are non-reversible. The materials in the electrodes
				are completely utilized and therefore cannot regenerate electricity. Primary batteries are often used when long periods of storage are required, as they
				have a much lower discharge rate than secondary batteries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of primary batteries is exemplified by smoke detectors, flashlights, and most remote controls.

					Secondary batteries
				</a>
				are rechargeable. These batteries undergo electrochemical reactions that can be readily reversed. The chemical reactions that occur in secondary batteries
				are reversible because the components that react are not completely used up. Rechargeable batteries need an external electrical source to recharge them
				after they have expended their energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of secondary batteries is exemplified by car batteries and portable electronic devices.

				Battery Cell Types
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Wet Cells
			</h4>
			<p>
				Wet cell batteries contain a liquid electrolyte. They can be either primary or secondary batteries. Due to the liquid nature of wet cells, insulator sheets
				are used to separate the anode and the cathode. Types of wet cells include Daniell cells, Leclanche cells (originally used in dry cells), Bunsen cells,
				Weston cells, Chromic acid cells, and Grove cells. The lead-acid cells in automobile batteries are wet cells.

			</p>
			<h4>
				Dry Cells
			</h4>
			<p>
				In dry cell batteries, no free liquid is present. Instead the electrolyte is a paste, just moist enough to allow current flow. This allows the dry cell
				battery to be operated in any position without worrying about spilling its contents. This is why dry cell batteries are commonly used in products which are
				frequently moved around and inverted, such as portable electronic devices. Dry cell batteries can be either primary or secondary batteries. The most common
				dry cell battery is the Leclanche cell.

				<h2>BASIC COMPONENTS OF AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				A simple electric circuit has at least three components:
			</p>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
				<li>
					A source of energy, such as a battery.
				</li>
				<li>
					Conducting material, such as the electric wires. These are mainly metals such as silver, copper, aluminum, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					A device that transfers the energy for a useful purpose, such as the bulb that provides light, also called a load.
				</li>
				<li>
					Switch
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				When these are present in a closed path, we have current flowing through the circuit and the bulb lighting up. This is called a closed circuit. The
				conductor is responsible for providing the path of movement for electric current. The switch allows the user to close or open the circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, when there is an insulator such as a rubber or even a gap of air in the path, current ceases to flow and we say the circuit is open-circuited.
				This happens because insulators do not allow current to pass through them. They are therefore called non-conducting material. Some other examples of
				non-conducting material are: wood, plastic, glass, ceramics, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The essence of having a battery in the setup is to serve as a source of voltage. One voltage is the energy needed to drive a unit of current through a unit
				resistance. In other words, the source of voltage provides the energy that drives the current around the path. Voltage is also called potential difference,
				is measured in Volts (V) and the voltage across a component is measured with a voltmeter connected across it, or <strong>in parallel with it</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Current is the total charges that pass a point per second</strong>
				. Mathematically, this is represented as
			</p>
			<p align="center">
				<img width="278" height="62" src="../../../../images/clip_image017.gif"/>
			</p>
			<p>
			That is, the speed at which charges is moving in the path. It is measured in Amperes (A), and the current through a component is measured with an ammeter    <strong>connected in series</strong> with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The device that transfers the energy for a useful purpose is a form of resistance. <strong>Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current.</strong> As
				the device opposes the flow of current , charges lose their energy to the device, and this lost energy is converted into forms of energy such as heat (in
				the case of the iron, or the electric stove) or light ( in the case of a light bulb). Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω) and with an ohmmeter.

				<h3>Connection types</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, there are two types of connections: the series connection and the parallel connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Series connection: two components are said to be connected in series when the positive side (terminal) of one is connected to the negative terminal of the
				other. For example, we connect two cells in series when we connect the tip (ie., the positive terminal) of one to the base (ie., the negative terminal) of
				the other. In the series connection, removal of one battery results in an open circuit. When two cells are connected in series, their voltages add up and
				together, they produce a current equal to the sum of their individual currents. This means that series-connected cells give of more current, and hence more
				brightness to lamps. However, they die down faster.

				Parallel connection: two components are said to be connected in parallel when the positive terminal of one is connected to the positive terminal of the
				other, and the negative terminals as well. When this happens, the batteries have the same value. When one battery is removed, it does not affect the other
				and the bulb is still lit. Hence, this connection is mostly used in homes and buildings.

				<h2>The Ohm’s Law</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Ohm was a scientist who devoted time in developing the concept of electricity. He came up with a law that showed the relationship between current,
				resistance and voltage. The following is a summary of the Ohm’s law:
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>
					The voltage across a component in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current through it, the constant of proportionality being the
					resistance of the component.
				</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mathematically, the Ohm’s law is stated as:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img width="232" height="27" src="../../../../images/clip_image037.gif"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<img width="389" height="27" src="../../../../images/clip_image039.gif"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that as the voltage across a component increases, the current increases as well. Nevertheless, the resistance is constant.

				<h2>Power</h2>

			<p>

				electrical energy is converted into some other form of energy. Mathematically, power, in electrical energy terms, is given by

				<h2>Some electrical gadgets</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				The electric heater:
			</p>
			<p>
				Electric heaters have been around for decades as a source of heat in homes to provide warmth to us. One of the reason for their popularity is because of
				lower cost to purchase and easy maintenance compared to other sources of heat. They are usually powered by electricity though a small percentage are still
				using propane or kerosene as fuel. They work by converting electricity into heat using metals as heating elements. The metals have high resistance that
				permit a certain amount of current to flow though them to provide the required heat. Electrical energy is changed into heat energy.
				<img border="0" width="291" height="244" src="../../../../images/clip_image051.gif" alt="heater.PNG"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The loud speaker:
			</p>
			<p>
				When things shake about, or vibrate, they make the <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/sound.html">sounds</a> we can hear in the world around us.
				Sound is invisible most of the time, but sometimes you <em>can</em> actually see it! If you thump a kettle-drum with a stick, you can see the tight drum
				skin moving up and down very quickly for some time afterward—pumping sound waves into the air. Loudspeakers work in
			</p>
			<p>
				<img border="0" width="248" height="253" src="../../../../images/clip_image053.gif" alt="speaker.PNG"/>
				<img border="0" width="522" height="212" src="../../../../images/clip_image055.gif" alt="speaker2.PNG"/>
			</p>
			<p>
			a similar way. At the front of a loudspeaker, there is a fabric, <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/plastics.html">plastic</a>,<a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/papermaking.html">paper</a>, or lightweight metal <strong>cone</strong> (sometimes called a    <strong>diaphragm</strong>) not unlike a drum skin (colored gray in our picture). The outer part of the cone is fastened to the outer part of the
				loudspeaker's circular metal rim. The inner part is fixed to an <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/ironsteel.html">iron</a> coil (sometimes called
			the <strong>voice coil</strong>, colored orange in the diagram) that sits just in front of a permanent    <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/magnetism.html">magnet</a> (sometimes called the <strong>field magnet</strong>, and colored yellow). When you hook
			up the loudspeaker to a stereo, electrical signals feed through the speaker cables (red) into the coil. This turns the coil into a temporary magnet or    <strong>electromagnet</strong>. As the <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/electricity.html">electricity</a> flows back and forth in the cables, the
				electromagnet either attracts or repels the permanent magnet. This moves the coil back and forward, pulling and pushing the loudspeaker cone. Like a drum
				skin vibrating back and forth, the moving cone pumps sounds out into the air.
			</p>
			<p>
				The electric motor:
			</p>
			<p>
				The electric motor basically converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. When current is passed through a coil of wire, a magnetic field appears
				around the entire wire. On two sides, the magnetic forces add up, making the force in that region higher than elsewhere. Thus, the magnetic force pushes
				the coil and causes it to rotate around a rod called the rotor.

				<h3>Protection of appliances</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				Every appliance connects to power supply by its plug. Thus, a plug serves as a point of connection for an appliance. A plug may be two-pin (that is, have
				only two pins that fit into a socket) or three-pin (that is, have three pins that fit into a socket).
			</p>
			<p>
				The three pins of a three-pin plug are the live pin, the neutral pin, and the earth pin. The live pin is connected to the live wire, which carries power or
				current to the appliance. Since this wire is very active, it is important that it is controlled to limit how much current is taken to the appliance. Hence,
			a fuse is inserted in the live wire, just after the live pin. The fuse is a protective device, and is essentially    <strong>a thin wire that melts when too much current passes through it.</strong> The incidence of too much current in an appliance may be caused by
				electrical faults within the appliance, or in the national grid. The live wire is brown in color, or red in some cases.
			</p>
			<p>
				The neutral pin is connected to the neutral wire, which serves as the return path for current after passing through the appliance. It is blue in color, or
				black in some cases.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then there is the earth pin, which is connected to the earth wire. The earth wire is another protective measure. There are times when current in the live
				wire leaks to the casing of the appliance, endangering the lives of the users. Thus, the earth wire is connected to the casing of the appliance in order to
				serves a return path for current that leaks. By doing this, a heavy current is drawn and the fuse melts. The earth wire is green and yellow in color.
